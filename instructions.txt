A partially completed version of the project already exists. You are now asked to .. finish it off. 

The design has already been signed off and so you must not alter the appearance of the system. 

All of the code already present is relevant and so you must make sure that you understand 
the methods deployed such as:
        
        button attributes to open modals, 
        classes to conditionally hide elements depending on device size, 
        modal show events ("show.bs.modal"), 
        form submit event handling 
        frequent calls to the database to ensure that the app is using the most up to data values.


Study it carefully and then provide the missing functionality according to the methods of 
deployment that are already in place.

Find a link to the SQL and sample PHP in the zip file below. The PHP routines can be used in your 
solution but you will also have to develop others to complete your development. Please do not 
change the structure or indexes of any of the tables and when designing the workflow bear in 
mind the following: 

    The UI must allow for maintenance of the all of the tables in the database, 
    protect its integrity and not allow the user to compromise it by deleting records with dependencies

    The model supports only one location per department
    
    This is a server based solution that can be accessed by multiple users at any time.
